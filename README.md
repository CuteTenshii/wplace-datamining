# Wplace.live Datamining

![GitHub Actions Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/actions/workflow/status/CuteTenshii/wplace-datamining/.github%2Fworkflows%2Flatest.yml)

Datamining for the Wplace.live website. Files are in the `output` directory, but the script renames them because their hashes change every time a new build is made by Wplace.
